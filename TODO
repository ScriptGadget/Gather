# To Do

## General TODO

+ Bug: Why do Readings sometimes display out of order?
+ Setup a MongoDB connection.
+ Eject and strip Gather. Test build for iOS and Android.
+ Document deployment process, interface, architecture and design.
+ Management and Integration documentation
+ iOS Testing
+ Timed Sync?
+ Hosting / Domain
+ Clear entry field on "Done" (may be an Android thing)

## Deferred

+ Move the test data setup to a Boot script to work with Auth.
+ Pumpers should only have access to POST /login, POST /logout, POST /Readings and GET /Routes/mine. Admin should have acceess to everything.
+ Should /mine return Object instead of string?
+ Authentication: wire signedIn through props
+ Invalidate token on signout.
+ Import new routes as JSON?


## Done

+ For Gather, just use Redux with SignIn (and SignOut?), then send the user key in the header with each Fetch.
+ For Store, Routes must belong to a particular pumper. (Two pumpers with the same site will have two different Route objects so they can change independently).
+ Authorization: Routes
+ Authentication: send user key
+ Integrate Auth with the other API calls.
+ Move Auth functions to Store
+ Fix "last synced" indicator. (not showing for some reason)
+ Reporting (/reading GET with UUIDs for the win)
+ Use UUIDS (maybe even as keys?).
+ Separate new readings from old.
+ Use redux-persist to check local first.
+ Clear all state on logout.
+ Send readings when we can.
