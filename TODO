## To Do
+ Integrate Auth with the other storage and API calls.
+ Authentication: wire signedIn through props
+ Authorization: Routes
+ Should /mine return Object instead of string?
+ Management and Integration documentation
+ iOS Testing
+ Timed Sync?
+ Hosting / Domain
+ Clear entry field on "Done" (may be an Android thing)
+ Import new routes as JSON?

## Done
+ Move Auth functions to Store
+ Fix "last synced" indicator. (not showing for some reason)
+ Reporting (/reading GET with UUIDs for the win)
+ Use UUIDS (maybe even as keys?).
+ Separate new readings from old.
+ Use redux-persist to check local first.
+ Clear all state on logout.
+ Send readings when we can.
